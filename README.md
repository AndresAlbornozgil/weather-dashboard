# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I built it with the idea to help travelers to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that they can plan trips accordingly. This way they can prepare properly and prevent any bad weather ruining their day or trip. I learned that API's are a really powerful and useful tool as well as that we as developers build our work on top of other's developer's work.
